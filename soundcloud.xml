I bet this is how all those homeless people felt when David Guy Levy, producer of the upcoming film Terri, generously gave to the LA Food Bank this past Christmas. However, as you'll learn from this episode, his donation was not completely selfless: He got to co-host Comedy Bang Bang! Along with mostly-enjoyed guest Harris Wittels and a special surprise guest he brought himself, David guides us through segments like Harris' Phone Corner and the What's Up Hot Dog Memorial Plugs. Be sure to see Terri this weekend! David supports us so let's support him!</itunes:summary>

      <description>Two Comedy Bang Bangs in one week? Why, this must be a Christmas miracle! I bet this is how all those homeless people felt when David Guy Levy, producer of the upcoming film Terri, generously gave to the LA Food Bank this past Christmas. However, as you'll learn from this episode, his donation was not completely selfless: He got to co-host Comedy Bang Bang! Along with mostly-enjoyed guest Harris Wittels and a special surprise guest he brought himself, David guides us through segments like Harris' Phone Corner and the What's Up Hot Dog Memorial Plugs. Be sure to see Terri this weekend! David supports us so let's support him!</description>

      <itunes:summary>Comedy Bang Bang welcomes back an old friend this week with Rob Corddry. With him comes his beautiful and hilarious Childrens Hospital co-star Erinn Hayes who has a kind word for everyone in the room. Even the despicable and disgusting Dov Charney of American Apparel is subject to Erinn's kindess, despite his repeated attempts to violate her in the most sustainable, organic way possible. With the return of Mr. Corddry, we also see the return of past features What Am I Thinking? and Jukebox Jury. If you're curious about future episodes of Childrens Hospital (how can you not be?) or want to hear about Scott's past experience as an American Apparel model (I mean, come on now!), tune on in to Comedy Bang Bang!</itunes:summary>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;And the Oscar for Outstanding Episode of a Comedy Podcast goes to: THIS EPISODE OF Comedy Bang Bang: The Podcast! Additionally, the Oscar for Outstanding Former Musician Who is Now a Comedian and Does the Theme Song goes to Reggie Watts! Of course, the Oscar for Outstanding Call-Back to a Previous Episode goes to Jeremy Piven. We just have one more, the Oscar for Outstanding New Feature which will go to Oscar Trivia. No Oscars for Paul Giamatti because he's fat and bald and doesn't bathe.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <itunes:summary>Lovers of spoken-word poetry and vokka rejoice! Harris Wittels once again has his dream of an hour-long phone corner dashed by craft-services coordinator and pudding aficionado Fabrice Fabrice. No disrespect, but Bobby Bottleservice comes by and relieves Fabrice of his interrupting-and-mocking duties with important info about upcoming events and his relationship with his mother. Jukebox Jury is back, and somehow overwhelmingly positive. Listen through the very end to hear Engineer Doug's opus based on last week's episode, Steak Shake, available from the Earwolf Store. Keep leaving your catchphrase suggestions, and go vote on the What's Up Hot Dog Poll.</itunes:summary>

      <itunes:summary>Listeners beware, you're in for a scare this week on Comedy Bang Bang!First of all, what could be scarier than a CYBER-THUG TAKEOVER!?!!? The Thuggy One and his buddy Miles Archer take over the show to talk about the spooky world of prison with a full soundtrack from Eban Schletter's Witching Hour. Thug and Archer very kindly allow Scott to stay in the studio (mainly to talk about the new Earwolf app) as some ghastly guests come by. The Ghost Boy who has been haunting the Earwolf studio finally reveals himself, and brings in some much needed levity with his happy songs and silly jokes. Messmore and Bueford LeBaron, innkeepers of Suicide House, join the show mainly to talk about their dicks and ghoul-themed daytime television. In an effort to regain the journalistic integrity of the show, Scott has on Leo Karpatze to sing for us the first draft of Monster Mash, which the guests use as an excuse to start a cypher. Of course, it wouldn't be a Halloween episode of Comedy Bang Bang without a round of Spook You Rather! Head on over to the Earwolf Store to buy your "Coolest Person on the Planet" Halloween costume and don't forget to check out the Earwolf App!</itunes:summary>
