amalgam career of abstract academic and [hands-on], practical systems and policies (and vagaries) of building, maintaining, and distributing datasets vital to immediate research and implentation as well as future re-use, iteration and accumulation

background in academic and practical librarianship but also on the front lines of data management and use; i know very well the frustration of unmanaged data; i know the vagaries and complications of managing data; but i also know that it does get done - the explosion of mobile couldn't have happened without clearly-written, clearly-documented APIs and other data access endpoints (but mostly APIs); the moden web is basically all what used to be misnomered as "mashups" when, it turns out, it's really a design principle that makes absolute sense in digital - platform/framework + api/endpoint + ?? = usable application. 

long commitment to making data open and available

long commitment to making data discoverable, understandable, and re-usable for the next team, project, or citizen down the line
