Identified the BNSF rail lines from NTAD (http://www.rita.dot.gov/bts/sites/rita.dot.gov.bts/files/publications/national_transportation_atlas_database/2014/polyline), clipped by the state polys from same (http://www.rita.dot.gov/bts/sites/rita.dot.gov.bts/files/publications/national_transportation_atlas_database/2014/polygon). Simplified by .05 in QGIS, dissolved in QGIS, manually yanked the "type" tuple from GeoJSON and pasted into CartoDB.
